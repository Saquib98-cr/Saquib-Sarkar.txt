Lab1 Assignment

Good Afternoon,

My name is Saquib Sarkar. I am a senior Computer Science major at Bradley University, and I will be graduating this semester. My favorite subjects are math, literature, and history. My favorite hobbies is to watch/play soccer, ride my bike, go rollerblading, read books, and learn more about new technology and world history & culture. I'm excited to be here and I hope to learn a lot from this class. I hope to find a job and work at a good company in the near future.

Sincerely,

Saquib Sarkar
